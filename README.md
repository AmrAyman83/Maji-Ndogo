The Maji Ndogo dataset is a collection of water quality data from over 30,000 water points in Africa.

The Maji Ndogo dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers working to improve water quality in Africa. The data can be used to track trends in water quality over time, identify areas where water quality is poor, and develop interventions to improve water quality.

Our first step was to identify the key information we needed to focus on. This included data on population, water resources, and infrastructure. Once we had identified the key information, we began to clean up our data using SQL. This involved removing errors and inconsistencies, and formatting the data in a way that would be easy to analyze.

One specific example of data cleaning was removing the space between the first and last names in the employee table. We also trimmed off the space at the end of the phone numbers. This was important because it ensured that the data was consistent and accurate.

Another important step was to update the employee table with email addresses for all of our workers. This will allow us to communicate with them more effectively and keep them updated on our progress.

Once we had cleaned up our data, we were ready to begin our data exploration journey. We used SQL to query the data and identify patterns and trends. For example, we looked at the relationship between population and water resources, and we identified the areas of the country that were most in need of water infrastructure.
